<development>
<git>Prefer rebase over merge</git>

<architecture>
- Use Clean Architecture principles
- Use Domain-Driven Design patterns
- Use SOLID principles
</architecture>
<philosophy>
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.
</philosophy>
<principles>
- Fail Fast: Check for potential errors early and raise exceptions immediately when issues occur
</principles>
</development>
